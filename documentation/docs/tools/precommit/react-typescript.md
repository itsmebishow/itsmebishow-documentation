## Steps to Set Up Pre-commit Hooks in a React TypeScript Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

You’ll need to install the pre-commit package (if it's not already installed) and configure the hooks.

First, install the necessary tools:

```bash
# Install pre-commit package
pip install pre-commit
```

Then, you'll need to install the tools you want to use in your React TypeScript project. Most common tools are:

- [ESLint](#) (for linting)
- [Prettier](#) (for formatting)
- [TypeScript](#) (for type checking)

Run the following commands to install these tools in your project:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    # Install ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript if not already installed
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier typescript
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    ```

Additionally, you might want to install TypeScript-specific ESLint plugins, like `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, and Prettier plugins for code formatting:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    # ESLint plugins for TypeScript
    npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

    # Prettier plugin for ESLint
    npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    ```

### 2. Set Up ESLint and Prettier Configuration Files

Create configuration files for ESLint and Prettier.

=== "`eslintrc.json` (for ESLint)"

    ```json
    {
        "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
        "extends": [
            "eslint:recommended",
            "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
            "plugin:react/recommended",
            "plugin:prettier/recommended"
        ],
        "parserOptions": {
            "ecmaVersion": 2020,
            "sourceType": "module",
            "project": "./tsconfig.json"
        },
        "rules": {
            "prettier/prettier": "error"
        },
        "env": {
            "browser": true,
            "es2020": true
        }
    }
    ```

=== "`.prettierrc` (for Prettier)"

    ```json
    {
        "semi": true,
        "singleQuote": true,
        "trailingComma": "all",
        "printWidth": 80
    }
    ```

=== "`tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript)"

    `tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript, if not already set up) Ensure that your TypeScript configuration includes `"strict": true` to enforce strict type checking.

### 3. Configure Pre-commit Hooks

Now, create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of your project to specify the hooks you want to run before commits.

Here’s an example `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs [ESLint](#), [Prettier](#), and [TypeScript](#) checks:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
  rev: v8.36.0  # Ensure this matches the version you want to use
  hooks:
    - id: eslint
      name: eslint
      files: \.(ts|tsx)$
      additional_dependencies:
        - eslint
        - @typescript-eslint/parser
        - @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
        - eslint-plugin-react
        - eslint-config-prettier
        - eslint-plugin-prettier

- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
  rev: v2.8.0  # Ensure this matches the version you want to use
  hooks:
    - id: prettier
      name: prettier
      files: \.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|json|css|scss|md)$

- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-typescript
  rev: v4.9.4  # Ensure this matches the version you want to use
  hooks:
    - id: typescript
      name: typescript
      files: \.(ts|tsx)$
      additional_dependencies:
        - typescript
```

This configuration will run:

- **ESLint** to check for linting issues in TypeScript files (`.ts` and `.tsx`).
- **Prettier** to ensure consistent code formatting.
- **TypeScript** to ensure type checking is done.

### 4. Install the Pre-commit Hooks

Run the following command to install the pre-commit hooks from the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will add the necessary configuration to your `.git/hooks` directory, allowing the hooks to run automatically when you attempt to commit.

### 5. Test the Pre-commit Hooks

Now, when you make a commit, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically. For example:

- **If there are any linting issues** (from ESLint), the commit will be blocked.
- **If the code is not formatted correctly** (according to Prettier), it will be auto-fixed before committing.
- **If TypeScript detects any type errors**, the commit will be blocked.

If you'd like to run the hooks manually (before making a commit), you can use:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This runs all hooks on all files in your project, so you can make sure everything is in order before committing.

### 6. Optional: Add More Hooks

If you want to add more hooks for other checks (like testing, spell checking, etc.), you can modify the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to include additional hooks.

For example:

- Commit message linting using `commitlint`:

  ```yaml
  -   repo: https://github.com/commitlint/mirror
      rev: v14.0.0
      hooks:
          - id: commitlint
          name: commitlint
          files: ^(.*\.js|.*\.ts|.*\.jsx|.*\.tsx|.*\.md)$

  ```

**Benefits of Using Pre-commit Hooks in React TypeScript Projects:**

- **Prevents committing broken code**: Helps catch issues like linting errors, formatting problems, and TypeScript type errors before code is committed.
- **Consistent code style**: Enforces consistent code formatting across the project.
- **Boosts productivity**: Automates repetitive tasks like linting and formatting, so you can focus on writing code instead of manually fixing style issues.

Using pre-commit hooks in your React TypeScript project helps maintain high code quality and smooth collaboration across a tea
