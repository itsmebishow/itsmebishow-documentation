Yes! You can create a separate GitHub Pages site for an organization on GitHub. Here's how you can set up a GitHub organization page using GitHub Pages.

---

## ✅ Steps to Create a GitHub Organization Page:

### 🔧 1. Create a Repository Named your-org.github.io

1.  Go to your **GitHub organization account**.

2.  Create a new repository with the exact name:

    👉 `your-org.github.io`
    (Replace `your-org` with your organization's GitHub username.)

    **⚠️ Important**: The repository name must match this format for GitHub Pages to recognize it as an organization page.

---

### 📁 2. Add Your Website Files

- Clone the newly created repository:

  ```bash title="bash"
  git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-org.github.io
  cd your-org.github.io
  ```

- Add your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other static files for your website.

---

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1.  Go to your repository's **Settings**.
2.  Under the **Pages** section, choose the **branch** from which you want to serve the site (usually `main`).
3.  Click **Save**.

---

### 🌐 4. Access Your Organization Page

Once published, your organization’s page will be live at:

👉 `https://your-org.github.io`

---

### 🎨 Optional: Customize Your Organization Page

- You can use any static site generator like `Jekyll`, `Next.js` (static export), or `Gatsby` to make your site dynamic.
- You can also connect your custom domain from the **Pages settings**.
