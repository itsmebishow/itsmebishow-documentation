## GOAL

Goal setting is a subject that altered my life forever. I hadn't known my mentor, Mr. Earl Shoaff, for very long when one day he said to me, “Mr. Rohn, let me see your current list of goals. I've had a Lot of experience and I've been out here for a while, so let's go over them and maybe I can really give you — some good ideas.” And I said, ==“I don't have a list." He said, “Well, if you don't have a list of your goals, I can guess your bank balance within a few hundred dollars.” And he did==.

==That got my attention==. I said, “**You mean my bank balance would be a lot bigger if I learned how to set goals?**” He said, “**Drastically bigger.**” So, I finally said, “==Hey, I want to learn how to set goals.=="

==It is a fantastic skill to develop, how to design your own future.==

**A life best lived is a life by design. Not by accident, and not by just walking through the day careening from wall to wall and managing to survive.**

That's okay. But if you can start giving your life dimensions and design and color and objectives and purpose, the results can be absolutely staggering.

## SMART Goals

SMART means Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-sensitive,

- **Specific**: Don't be vague. Exactly what do you want?

- **Measurable**: Quantify your goal. How will you know if you've achieved it or not?

- **Attainable**: Be honest with yourself about what you can reasonably accomplish at this point in your life while taking into consideration your current responsibilities.

- **Realistic**: It's got to be doable, real and practical.

- **Time**: Associate a time frame with each goal. When should you complete the goal?
