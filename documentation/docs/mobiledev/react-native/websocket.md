## Introduction


WebSockets provide a solution to the limitations of HTTP when it comes to real-time, bidirectional communication. To understand why WebSockets are necessary and how they differ from HTTP, we need to explore both protocols in depth.


### 1. What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of communication on the web. It is a **request-response protocol**, which means that a client (like a web browser or mobile app) makes a request to the server, and the server responds with the data.

???+ info "How HTTP Works:"

    -   **Client-initiated**: The client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data (e.g., HTML, JSON).
    -   **One-way communication**: Once the server responds, the connection is closed.
    -   **Stateless**: Each request is independent. The server does not retain any memory of previous requests.

???+ question "Limitations of HTTP:"

    -   **No real-time updates**: If the client needs updated information (like new chat messages), it has to keep asking the server by sending new requests.
    -   **Polling required for real-time applications**: To achieve a "real-time" effect, HTTP often relies on polling, which involves sending frequent requests to the server (e.g., every second). This is inefficient because most of the time, the server responds with nothing new, wasting resources.
    -   **Latency**: Even with techniques like polling or long polling, there's often a noticeable delay between sending and receiving data.



### 2. The Theory Behind WebSockets

**WebSockets** were designed to overcome the limitations of HTTP by enabling **full-duplex** communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. They allow the server to push data to the client as soon as it's available, without the client needing to ask for updates repeatedly.


???+ info "Key Concepts of WebSockets:"

    -   **Full-duplex**: WebSockets allow both the client and server to send messages to each other at any time. This is what "bidirectional" means: either side can initiate communication.
    -   **Persistent connection**: Unlike HTTP, WebSockets keep the connection open after the initial handshake, allowing continuous communication without the overhead of re-establishing a new connection.
    -   **Low-latency communication**: Because the connection is kept open, messages are sent and received almost instantly, making it suitable for real-time applications.



???+ example "How WebSockets Work:"


    1.  **Initial Handshake**: WebSockets start as an HTTP connection. The client sends an HTTP request to initiate the WebSocket protocol, using a special header:


        ```http
        GET /chat HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        The `Upgrade: websocket` header tells the server that the client wants to switch from HTTP to WebSockets. If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with:

        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        Once this handshake is complete, the connection switches from HTTP to WebSocket, and the connection remains open.

    
    2.  **Message Frames**: After the handshake, data is sent over the WebSocket in small units called frames. These frames can carry text, binary data, or control information.

        -   Text Frames: For sending messages in a text format (e.g., JSON).
        -   Binary Frames: For sending binary data (e.g., images, files).
        -   Ping/Pong Frames: Keep the connection alive by checking whether the other side is still connected.

    
    3.  **Real-Time Communication**: Once the connection is established, both the client and server can send messages to each other without needing to re-establish a connection. This makes WebSockets ideal for real-time applications like chat, live notifications, stock updates, gaming, etc.





### 3. Why HTTP Alone Can't Do Bidirectional Communication

HTTP was designed for a request-response pattern. The inherent problem with HTTP for bidirectional communication is that it is unidirectional by nature:

-   **Client-driven**: The client always initiates the request, and the server can only respond to the clientâ€™s request. This means the server can't push data to the client unless the client asks for it.
-   **Connection overhead**: Each time the client makes a request, it needs to establish a new connection, which is slow and inefficient for real-time communication.
-   **No event-driven communication**: Since HTTP doesn't keep the connection open, there's no way for the server to notify the client of new events (e.g., new messages in a chat) without the client asking for updates.


To simulate real-time communication over HTTP, developers use techniques like:

-   **Polling**: The client repeatedly sends requests at regular intervals to check if there's new data (e.g., every second). This is inefficient and puts a heavy load on the server.
-   **Long Polling**: The client sends a request, and the server holds the connection open until new data is available. The server responds once new data arrives, and the client immediately sends another request. This reduces the number of requests but still has latency issues.
-   **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: This allows the server to push updates to the client over a single, one-way HTTP connection. While it solves some problems, it's still only one-way (server to client), not truly bidirectional.




### 4. Advantages of WebSockets Over HTTP for Real-Time Communication

-   **Bidirectional communication**: Both client and server can send and receive data simultaneously, which makes WebSockets perfect for real-time applications like chat systems, live feeds, and multiplayer games.
-   **Reduced latency**: WebSockets eliminate the need for repeated HTTP requests, reducing latency and improving the responsiveness of the app.
-   **Less overhead**: After the initial WebSocket handshake, the connection remains open, so there's no need to establish new connections for each message, reducing the overhead associated with HTTP.
-   **Scalability**: WebSockets can handle many open connections without overwhelming the server, making them scalable for real-time applications.



### 5. When to Use WebSockets

WebSockets are ideal when you need low-latency, real-time, bidirectional communication. Some common use cases include:

-   **Chat applications**: Real-time messaging between users where both parties need to send and receive data instantly.
-   **Real-time notifications**: Apps where the server needs to push updates to the client immediately (e.g., stock trading, sports scores).
-   **Collaborative apps**: Real-time collaboration tools like Google Docs or whiteboard apps where multiple users work together in real time.
-   **Online multiplayer games**: Games that require instant communication between players and the server.
-   **Live video/audio streaming**: Where real-time feedback is essential.




### 6. Comparison Between WebSockets and HTTP Techniques

| Feature             | HTTP Polling/Long Polling         | Server-Sent Events (SSE)       | WebSockets                        |       
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------| --------------------------------- |
| Connection Type     | Multiple short-lived connections  | Single one-way connection      | Single bidirectional connection   |
| Communication       | Client to server                  | Server to client only          | Full-duplex (both directions)     |
| Latency             | High latency                      | Medium latency                 | Low latency                       |

| Scalability         | Limited                           | Limited                        | Scalable (many open connections)  |
| Use Cases           | Simple polling needs              | Push notifications, updates    | Real-time chat, gaming, etc.      |



### 7. Potential Challenges with WebSockets

-   **Connection Management**: You need to manage open WebSocket connections carefully, especially in large-scale applications.
-   **Load Balancing**: WebSocket connections are long-lived, so load balancing WebSocket traffic can be more challenging than HTTP requests.
-   **Security**: WebSockets require careful attention to security, such as handling authentication, protecting against attacks like cross-site WebSocket hijacking, and ensuring SSL/TLS encryption.



## Conclusion:

-   **HTTP** is great for traditional web communication where the client initiates requests and the server responds with the requested data. But it is inefficient for real-time, bidirectional communication.
-   **WebSockets** solve this problem by providing a persistent, full-duplex connection that allows both the server and the client to communicate in real-time without the need for constant reconnections.

For applications like real-time chat, notifications, or collaborative apps, WebSockets are the most efficient and performant solution compared to using HTTP with polling or other techniques.

## Who developed web socket?

WebSockets were developed by Ian Hickson, a former member of the Google Chrome team and a key contributor to many web standards, including HTML5. WebSockets were initially proposed as part of the HTML5 specification and were later separated into their own specification by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).


**Timeline of WebSocket Development:**

1.  Initial Proposal (2008-2009): WebSockets were first proposed by Ian Hickson as part of the HTML5 specification, recognizing the need for a real-time, bidirectional communication protocol to overcome the limitations of HTTP.

2.  Standardization:
    
    -   The **IETF** (Internet Engineering Task Force) took over the protocol's development and defined it in **RFC 6455** in 2011. This document officially specifies the WebSocket protocol.
    -   Meanwhile, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) developed the API specification for WebSockets, which is now part of the broader HTML5 specification.

3.  Adoption: Major web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari began supporting WebSockets around 2010-2011, making it a widely accepted standard for real-time web applications.

Since then, WebSockets have become a fundamental tool for building modern, real-time web applications such as chat systems, live updates, and multiplayer games.

## WebSockets Usage:


Yes, WebSockets are available in most modern programming languages and frameworks, thanks to their standardized protocol (RFC 6455). Since WebSockets are a protocol for bidirectional communication, language-specific libraries or frameworks handle the implementation, making it easy to use WebSockets across different platforms.



=== "JavaScript"

    -   Client-side: WebSocket support is built into all modern browsers. You can directly use the `WebSocket` API.

    ```js
    const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');
    socket.onmessage = (event) => console.log(event.data);
    ```


=== "Node.js"

    -   Server-side: In Node.js, WebSocket support is provided by libraries like `ws`, `Socket.IO`, and `uWebSockets.js`.

    ```javascript
    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
    server.on('connection', (ws) => {
        ws.on('message', (message) => console.log(message));
    });

    ```


=== "2. Python"


    -   Libraries: WebSocket libraries like `websockets`, `Socket.IO` (via `python-socketio`), and `FastAPI` (with native WebSocket support) are commonly used.

        ```python
        import asyncio
        import websockets

        async def echo(websocket, path):
            async for message in websocket:
                await websocket.send(message)

        start_server = websockets.serve(echo, "localhost", 8765)
        asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
        asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
        ```



=== "3. PHP"

    -   Libraries: `Ratchet`, `Socket.IO` PHP, and `Workerman` provide WebSocket functionality."

        ```php
        use Ratchet\MessageComponentInterface;
        use Ratchet\ConnectionInterface;

        class WebSocketServer implements MessageComponentInterface {
            public function onMessage(ConnectionInterface $from, $msg) {
                foreach ($this->clients as $client) {
                    $client->send($msg);
                }
            }
        }
        ```


WebSockets are widely supported across nearly all programming languages. Each language offers its own set of libraries or frameworks to handle WebSocket connections, making it easy to implement real-time, bidirectional communication in a variety of environments.
