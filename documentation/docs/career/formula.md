## 10,000 hours 

To calculate how many days it will take to reach 10,000 hours of coding if you code 8 hours a day, you can use a simple formula:

Formula:

\( \text{Number of Days} = \frac{\text{Total Hours}}{Hours Per Day} \)


Example:

\( \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{10,000}}{8} = 1,250 days \)



So, if you spend 8 hours a day coding, it will take you 1,250 days to reach 10,000 hours of coding.

## Salary Increment Calculations

### Increment Amount

To calculate the amount of salary increment, use the following formula:

$$
\text{Increment Amount} = \text{Current Salary} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}\right)
$$

For example, if your current salary is $50,000 and the percentage increase is 5%, then:

$$
\text{Increment Amount} = 50{,}000 \times \left(\frac{5}{100}\right) = 50{,}000 \times 0.05 = 2{,}500
$$

### New Salary

To find the new salary after the increment, use:

$$
\text{New Salary} = \text{Current Salary} + \text{Increment Amount}
$$

Using the previous example:

$$
\text{New Salary} = 50{,}000 + 2{,}500 = 52{,}500
$$

### Percentage Increase

To calculate the percentage increase if you know the increment amount:

$$
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increment Amount}}{\text{Current Salary}}\right) \times 100
$$

For example, if the increment amount is \$2,500 and the current salary is \$50,000:

$$
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{2{,}500}{50{,}000}\right) \times 100 = 0.05 \times 100 = 5\%
$$

## Theory behind increment

The relationship between salary and salary increment is not strictly linear but depends on the percentage increase applied. Here’s a breakdown of how salary increments generally work:

### 1. Percentage-Based Increment

Most salary increments are calculated as a percentage of the current salary. This means that:

-   **Higher Salary = Higher Increment Amount**: If the percentage increase is the same, a higher salary will result in a higher increment amount because the increment is a percentage of the current salary.


Formula:

$$
\text{Increment Amount} = \text{Current Salary} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}\right)
$$


Example:

-   Current Salary: $50,000
-   Percentage Increase: 5%

    $$
    \text{Increment Amount} = \text{50,000} \times \left(\frac{\text{5}}{100}\right)
    $$

    $$
    \text{Increment Amount} = 50{,}000 \times 0.05 = 2{,}500
    $$


-   Current Salary: $100,000
-   Percentage Increase: 5%

    $$
    \text{Increment Amount} = \text{100,000} \times \left(\frac{\text{5}}{100}\right)
    $$

    $$
    \text{Increment Amount} = 100{,}000 \times 0.05 = 5{,}000
    $$

### 2. Fixed Increment Amount

In some cases, the increment might be a fixed amount rather than a percentage. For example:

-   Increment Amount: $3,000 (regardless of current salary)


Example:

-   Current Salary: $50,000

    ```
    New Salary = $50,000 + $3,000 = $53,000
    ```

-   Current Salary: $100,000

    ```
    New Salary = $100,000 + $3,000 = $103,000
    ```


In this scenario, the increment amount remains the same regardless of the current salary, so the impact on the new salary is proportional to the original salary.


----


### 3. Increment Based on Performance or Role

Sometimes, increments are influenced by factors such as:

-   **Performance**: Higher performance or meeting certain targets can result in a higher percentage increase or fixed increment.
-   **Role Changes**: A promotion or taking on more responsibilities might lead to a higher increment.
-   **Market Rates**: Increases might be adjusted based on industry standards or cost of living adjustments.


### Summary

-   **Percentage Increase**: The increment amount increases with the salary if the percentage increase is constant. A higher salary means a higher increment amount due to the percentage being applied to a larger base.

-   **Fixed Amount**: The increment amount is the same regardless of the salary. This approach doesn’t directly relate to the salary size but provides a uniform increase.

-   **Performance-Based**: Increments can vary based on performance evaluations or role changes, potentially leading to larger increases for higher achievers or those taking on greater responsibilities.

In essence, while a higher salary results in a higher increment amount when the increment is percentage-based, a fixed increment amount does not change with salary size.
