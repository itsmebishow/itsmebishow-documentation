# LinkedIn Optimize

## Featured section

The Featured section may not appear on your LinkedIn profile by default, but you can easily add it. Here's how:

### Adding the Featured Section:

1.  **Go to Your Profile**:

    - Click on your profile picture or name at the top of the LinkedIn homepage to go to your profile.

2.  **Click on "Add Profile Section"**:

    - Near the top of your profile, below your headline, you'll see a button that says "==Add profile section.==" Click on it.

3.  **Choose the Featured Section**:

    - Under the "==Featured==" dropdown, youâ€™ll find the option to add ==Featured==. It will be listed under the "**Recommended**" or "**Core**" section. Click on it.

4.  **Add Content to Featured**:

    Once the Featured section is added, you can click "**+**" to add media. From there, you can upload your CV (in PDF, DOC, or DOCX format) or link to it if it's hosted elsewhere (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).

Once the **Featured** section is visible, it will be placed below your **About** section, allowing visitors to view your CV and any other media or documents you upload.
