The `e.preventDefault()` method is a common practice in JavaScript when handling events, especially form submissions. It is used to prevent the default behavior associated with an event.

In the context of a form submission:

- **Without e.preventDefault()**: If you don't prevent the default behavior of a form submission, the browser will perform its default action, which usually involves sending a request to the server, causing a page reload or navigation.

- **With e.preventDefault()**: By calling `e.preventDefault()` within an event handler, you stop the default action associated with that event. In the case of a form submission, it prevents the browser from navigating away from the current page or triggering a full page reload.

```
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission behavior

  // Your custom logic for handling the form submission goes here
};
```
