## Decision Framework

To summarize, the micro-frontends decisions framework is composed of ==four key decisions==:

1. identifying,
2. composing,
3. routing, &
4. communicating.

### Routing Micro-Frontends

We wonâ€™t have any scalability issue in either case. The **client-side routing** ==is highly recommended== when your teams have stronger frontend skills so that it becomes natural having a client-side routing over a backend configuration.
