Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret text or data, such that the presence of the hidden message is not obvious. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable to unauthorized users, steganography aims to hide the fact that communication is occurring at all.


???+ info "Key Aspects of Steganography"

    1.  **Purpose**: The main goal is to hide information rather than just securing it. This can be useful for covert communication or watermarking.

    2.  **Techniques**:

        -   Image Steganography: Hides data within the pixels of an image. For instance, the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixel values can be altered to encode hidden information.
        -   Audio Steganography: Conceals data within audio files by manipulating certain audio properties or embedding data in inaudible frequencies.
        -   Text Steganography: Involves embedding hidden messages within text by using techniques such as altering word spacing, changing fonts, or using specific letter patterns.
        -   Video Steganography: Embeds information in video files, exploiting both spatial and temporal redundancies.
        -   Network Steganography: Conceals data within network protocols or traffic patterns.

???+ info "Choosing the Right Tool"

    When selecting a steganography tool, consider the following:

    -   **Type of Media**: Choose a tool that supports the type of media you are working with (images, audio, video, text).
    -   **Ease of Use**: Some tools are more user-friendly with graphical interfaces, while others may require command-line knowledge.
    -   **Encryption**: For added security, select tools that offer encryption features.
    -   **Detection and Analysis**: Tools for detecting steganography can be useful if you need to identify hidden data within media files.

These tools cater to different needs and levels of expertise, from simple, user-friendly applications to more complex command-line utilities.
