## Web Design

??? example "Hero Section"

    ==Types of hero section==

    The hero section of a website is typically the large, prominently placed section at the top of a webpage, often spanning the full width of the screen. It's one of the most critical parts of web design as it's the first thing visitors see and sets the tone for the rest of the site. There are several types of hero sections commonly used in web design:

    **1. Image Background Hero Section:** This type of hero section features a large, visually striking image as the background. It can be a static image or a slideshow/carousel of images. This type of hero section is popular because it immediately captures the visitor's attention.

    **2. Video Background Hero Section:** Similar to the image background hero section, but instead of a static image, it features a video playing in the background. This can be a full-screen video or a smaller video contained within the hero section. Video backgrounds can be particularly engaging and can help convey a brand's message effectively.

    **3. Text-Centric Hero Section:** In this type of hero section, the focus is on the text rather than the background image or video. The text may include a catchy headline, a brief description, and a call-to-action button. The background could be a solid color, a gradient, or a subtle pattern.

    **4. Product Showcase Hero Section:** If the website is focused on showcasing products or services, the hero section might feature a carousel or grid of images displaying the featured products or services. This type of hero section is common in e-commerce websites.

    **5. Interactive Hero Section:** An interactive hero section encourages user engagement through elements like sliders, interactive maps, or animations triggered by user actions. It's a more dynamic approach to the hero section, providing an immersive experience for visitors.

    **6. Minimalist Hero Section:** This type of hero section uses simple design elements, such as a single background image with minimal text and no distractions. It's clean, elegant, and allows the content to speak for itself.

    **7. Illustrated Hero Section:** Instead of using photographs or videos, this hero section features illustrations or graphics as the main visual element. It's a creative and unique approach that can help establish a brand's personality.

    **8. Split-Screen Hero Section:** In a split-screen hero section, the screen is divided into two sections, often with contrasting colors or images on each side. This design technique can be used to showcase two different aspects of a brand or to provide a visual comparison.

    These are just a few examples of the types of hero sections used in web design. The choice of hero section depends on factors such as the website's purpose, target audience, branding guidelines, and design preferences.

## BEM

CSS Naming Conventions

**BEM**, which stands for **Block**, **Element**, **Modifier**, is a popular ==CSS naming convention== that helps developers write more maintainable and modular CSS. It provides a structured way of naming CSS classes to make styles more predictable and easier to understand.

```html
<div class="block">
  <div class="block__element">
    <div class="block__element--modifier"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.block { /* block styles */ }
.block__element { /* element styles */ }
.block__element--modifier { /* modifier styles */ }
```

Here's a brief overview of BEM:

-   **Block:**
    
    A standalone component that is meaningful on its own. It represents a higher-level component or a module on the page.

    Blocks represent standalone entities or components on a web page. They are the top-level abstraction and should be independent, reusable pieces of UI. Examples could be headers, footers, navigation bars, cards, etc.

-   **Element:**

    A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. Elements are typically children of blocks and are named with double underscores (**`__`**) following the block name.

    Elements are parts of blocks and cannot exist outside of a block. They are semantically tied to the block they belong to and represent smaller components within that block. For example, within a card block, elements could include the card title, card content, card footer, etc.

-   **Modifier:**

    A flag on a block or element that changes its appearance or behavior. Modifiers are named with double hyphens (**`--`**) following the block or element name.

    Modifiers are flags on blocks or elements that alter their appearance or behavior. They allow for variations of a block or element without duplicating code. For example, a modifier could change the color, size, or state (such as active, inactive, etc.) of a block or element.

![bem structure](https://sourcedcode.com/storage/2022/01/bem-simple-example.1.png)

The philosophy behind BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) styling is to create a modular and reusable structure for CSS classes, enhancing maintainability, and reducing the risk of style conflicts in larger projects.

```html
<section class="main-section">
  <div class="block1">
    <h2 class="block1__title">Block 1 Title</h2>
    <p class="block1__description">Description for Block 1</p>
    <button class="block1__button">Button 1</button>
  </div>

  <div class="block2">
    <h2 class="block2__title">Block 2 Title</h2>
    <p class="block2__description">Description for Block 2</p>
    <button class="block2__button">Button 2</button>
  </div>
</section>
```
